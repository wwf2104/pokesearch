3. A description of the parts of your original proposal in Part 1 that you implemented, the parts you did not (which hopefully is nothing or something very small), and possibly new features that were not included in the proposal and that you implemented anyway. If you did not implement some part of the proposal in Part 1, explain why.

4. The main page is where the user can input their search requests in order to find entities that fit the request(s). They can toggle between the simple search which is based on the names of the entities and the advanced search which is based on an entity's attributes. Once they click on the 'find' button, these are sent to the corresponding simple/advanced find functions. The form inputs will be retrieved and the queries are rendered through jinja templates. While the simple find function is fairly straightforward, the advanced find function requires many templates in order to ensure that a user can search for more than more feature at a time within an entity. This is one of the more interesting pages because it can require many nested templates/queries in order to retrieve results.
Another interesting page is the results page in which the results are printed within a table. This relies on understanding the structure in which the results are retrieved from the previous query/queries and using nested for loops to create the correct <tr> and <td> tags. The reordering function essentially acts as the 'ORDER BY' statement within a sql statement through a javascript function and reorders the table without the user needing to refresh the page.
